## Project Overview

This project is a tribute to the early days of the web, reimagining Oracle’s website with a 90s-inspired design. It was developed as a fun exploration of web history and nostalgic UI design.

### Features:
- **Retro Aesthetic**: Authentic 90s-style fonts, layouts, and color schemes.
- **Static Content**: Reflecting the simple, text-heavy web pages of the era.
- **Featured Products Section**: Highlighting Oracle’s 90s product offerings such as servers, tools, applications, and OLAP.
- **News Section**: Dynamic links promoting Oracle’s initiatives like cartridge development and Java integration.
- **Minimal Interactivity**: Staying true to the web's limited functionality during that time.

## Technologies Used
